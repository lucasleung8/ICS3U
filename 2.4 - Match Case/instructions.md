# Instructions  
1. Write a program that asks for text input and provides atleast 3 possible responses based on what is input. You must use match case and not if, elif, else.
2. Write a program that asks what size of dice to roll one of (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20). The program should print a random dice roll for that dice. Ex if you input 6, the print should be "You rolled a {rollNumber}." where rollNumber is a random in between 1 and 6. If you roll a 20 on a 20 sided dice print "Congrats you win" instead. Use match case to start, you may use if/else within a case.
