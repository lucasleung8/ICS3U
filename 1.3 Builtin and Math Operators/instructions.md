# Instructions  

  1. Write a program that asks for a number 2 seperate times. After you have given it the numbers, it should print to screen "The result is x" where x will be the sum of the 2 numbers.

Hint : Look at the built in functions here: https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/functions.html. Consider using int() and str()

2. Extend your program from 1 to take in 2 more numbers. Assuming the 4 numbers are labeled a,b,c,d have the program print: "Your result is x" where x is (a+b)/(c+d)
