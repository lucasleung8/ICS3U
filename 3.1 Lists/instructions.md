# Instructions  

  1. Rewrite the program from task 2.3 question 2 using lists and the key word 'in' rather than multiple or statements
  2. Write a program that asks for input and returns the index of an item if in the list and "{item} is not in the list" if its not there. For a list of ['1', '5', '3', '8', 'cs', '149'] an input of 5 would pring "5 is at index 1", input of "cs" would print "cs is at index 4" and an input of "batman" would print "batman is not in the list". You can assume all items in the list are strings.
  3. Write a program that asks for 5 numbers. Create a list from those 5 numbers and then sort that list. Print the sorted list.
