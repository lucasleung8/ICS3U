# Instructions  

1. Write a program that asks for 3 numbers. The program should then print a statement about if the 3rd number is between the first 2. For example 2, 6 and 10 would print "10 is not between 2 and 6", but 2 100 and 80 would print 80 is between 2 and 100
2. Write a program that greets people. Your program should have 4 different greetings and 2 of them should be specific to multiple people. For example if the input is "Marco" there is one response, if the input is "Miller", "Brayden", or "Gabriel" there is a second input and if your input is "Omar", "Tavish", or "Rhedj" there is an other output.
3. Write a program that takes in a string, and returns true if that string contains all the letter of your first name.
