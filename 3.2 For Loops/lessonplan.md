2# Lesson plan
  
1. Write a program to accept a number from a user and calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number

For example, if the user entered 10 the output should be 55 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)

2.  Write a program to print multiplication table of a given number
For example, num = 2 so the output should be
```
2
4
6
8
10
12
14
16
18
20
```

3. Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range
Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers

Examples:

6 is not a prime mumber because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.

Given:

start = 25

end = 50

Expected output:
```
Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
29
31
37
41
43
47
```
