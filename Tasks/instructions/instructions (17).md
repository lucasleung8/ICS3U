# Task

You will write your exercise code in `main.py`.


- Write a program that recreates [this sketch](http://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise1_2O.png).

You can add your own details if you like, but you should have that sketch at a minimum.

Visit the [p5.js Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) if you want to investigate new things to try.
