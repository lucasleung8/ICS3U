# Instructions  

Make sure you have comments on your code.

1. Write a program that takes in a number and prints whether the number is even or odd, if it is a perfect square or not (square root of the number is an integer: 4, 9. 16, 25), if it is less than 20, if it is less than 1000, and if it is a prime number. (Code for if it is prime or perfect square is given to you)
2. write a program that has a nested if. Your program should ask for input 2 or more times, but the second input should only happen if the first passes some check. Hint: Think similar to the login example we did.
