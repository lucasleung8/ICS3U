# Instructions  

Using either for loops or while loops, write code for the following prompts


1. Write a program that asks for input 3 times. A starting number, and end number and a 3rd number will be our multiple. Your code should print out all multiples of the 3rd number that exist between the first 2.
  
   For example 2, 10, 3 as input would print 3, 6, 9.

   5, 25, 11 would print 11 and 22

   5, 6, 7 would not print anything

   49, 100, 5 would print 50, 55, 60, ..., 90, 95, 100

2. Assuming a list is given and defined, write a loop to calculate the average of all the numbers in the loop. for example myList = [3, 6, 20, 1] would have an average of 7.5


3. Extend the previous program to use a loop when asking for input so the user can enter the numbers they want the average for. For example:

```
How many numbers are you inputting? 5
1
4
6
3
5
The average of [1, 4, 6, 3, 6] is 4
```
