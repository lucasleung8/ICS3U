# Instructions  

You need to write 3 tests for each function.

1. Write a function called stringlength(myStr) to calculate the length of a string. You cannot use len(). stringlength("Hello") would return 5
2. Write a Python function called longestWord(myList) that takes a list of words. Print the longest word and return the length of the longest one. longestWord(['Hi', 'Batman', 'bob']) would print 'Batman' and return the value 6
3. write a function called countDigits(myString) that counts all digits given string for example countDigits('2He2llo2') would return 3 since there are 3 digits
4. Write a function called stringReversed(myString) that returns a string in reverse order (You must use a loop here and not a python shortcut).
5. Write a function called numberOfSentences(text) that counts the number of sentences in that string. A sentence being defined as a set of words seperated by a period. numberOfSentences('Hello everyone. Welcome back to class. Today we work on stirngs') would return 3
6. Write a Python function called stringToWords(myStr) to convert a given string into a list of lower case words with no puctuation. stringToWords('Hello Class. Today, we will be looking at Strings!') would return ['hello', 'class', 'today', ]
