# Instructions  

1) Print list in reverse order using a loop if the list is [3, 6, 7, 9, 12] the print should be
```
12
9
7
6
3
```
2) Assuming a list is defined such as myList = [3,5,6,3,7] use a while loop to calculate the average of the list.
   
3) Write a program to keep asking for a number until you enter a negative number. At the end, print the sum of all entered numbers. (Look at lesson 3.3 for an example of validating input)

4) Write a program to ask for a name until the user enters END. When you are done, print All the names entered on their own line  (Hint: Use a while loop for the input, save inputs in a list then a second while loop to print.)
