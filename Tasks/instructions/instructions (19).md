# Task(s)

You will write your exercise code in `script.js`.

- To have your code run, remember to replace `lessonCode.js` with `script.js` in the `index.html` file.

- Write a program that recreates [this sketch](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1030390). The key idea here is that there is only one line that includes an `ellipse()` in it.

- Your program should be able to generate a randomly sized `rect()` starting in the top left using a key press.
