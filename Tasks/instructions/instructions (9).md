# Instructions  
1. Rewrite 3.2 Q1, Q2 and Q3 using a while loop instead of a for loop.

2. Calculate the cube of all numbers from 1 to a given number
Write a program to print the cube of all numbers from 1 to a given number

Given 6 print
```
Current Number is : 1  and the cube is 1
Current Number is : 2  and the cube is 8
Current Number is : 3  and the cube is 27
Current Number is : 4  and the cube is 64
Current Number is : 5  and the cube is 125
Current Number is : 6  and the cube is 216
```

3. Ask for a positive integer
Display Fibonacci series up to as many terms as the input

The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers. The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The first two numbers are 0 and 1.

For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The next number in this series above is 13+21 = 34.

given 8 print
```
The 1st number of the Fibonacci series is 0
The 2nd number of the Fibonacci series is 1
The 3rd number of the Fibonacci series is 1
The 4th number of the Fibonacci series is 2
The 5th number of the Fibonacci series is 3
The 6th number of the Fibonacci series is 5
The 7th number of the Fibonacci series is 8
The 8th number of the Fibonacci series is 13
