# Task(s)


- Write a program that recreates [this sketch](https://mrseidel.com/images/Processing/2O/Exercise8_2O.gif). The main concept here is only having one `ellipse()/triangle()` for the top half of the sketch, and one `ellipse()` for the bottom half of the sketch. For the top half, you can choose to do **either** the `triangle()`s **or** the `ellipse()`s. You do not have to do both.
